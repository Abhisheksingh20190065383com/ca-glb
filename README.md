This version includes working UI, toasts, and an HDRI loader (uses RGBELoader). Buttons and features are fully wired:
- Upload (drag & drop + choose)
- Auto-rotate, Grid, Wireframe, Reset view
- Screenshot & Export GLB
- HDRI environment (loads from Poly Haven)
- Shadows toggle, Model info, Toast notifications
- Vercel-ready static site

Note: HDRI loads from an external URL at runtime — ensure the browser has internet access.
